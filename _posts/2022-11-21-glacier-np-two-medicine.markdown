    Running Eagle Falls was our first stop in the Two Medicine region. It was a short trek to the falls, which are named after a woman and war chief born into the Piik√°ni Piegan tribe of the Blackfeet Nation. The waterfall emerges from a sinkhole hidden behind a natural bridge above the creek, and Rising Wolf Mountain towers over the picturesque scene. Next, we stopped at Two Medicine Lake to take pictures of the iconic Sinopah Mountain. Sinopah is often called the crowned jewel of the Two Medicine region, and its name means "kit fox" in the Blackfeet language.

    We headed around Pray Lake to hike up the north shore trail toward Dawson Pass. Across the lake, we saw a family of four moose eating aquatic plants. It was the perfect opportunity to sit and watch them from a safe distance. When they headed into the undergrowth along the north shore, we decided to head up the south shore trail instead to avoid startling them as they went about their day.

    We hiked to the Aster Park Overlook. The trail started as a flat hike through meadows along the south shore of Two Medicine Lake. We checked out several ponds hoping to see some beavers, but they remained elusive. It was a steep climb past Aster Falls and up to the lookout, but there were wonderful views of Rising Wolf Mountain and lakes in the valley below.

    We ate our sandwiches back at Pray Lake, hoping to see more of the moose. The moose had moved on, but two bighorn sheep ambled through the campground. There weren't many people there that day, but it was still surprising to see them hanging out near the campground.

    On the drive back to our cabin, we stopped at Cascadilla River Access to admire the fall colors along the river. Autumn was a wonderful time to visit Glacier National Park, and we hope to return for more adventures soon.
