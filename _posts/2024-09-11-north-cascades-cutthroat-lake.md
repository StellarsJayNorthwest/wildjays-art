On our last day in the North Cascades area, we went to Cutthroat Lake, a shorter 3.8-mile hike and the farthest east of any of our other day hikes. The forest here felt different than the previous days and featured subalpine firs and sparse understory. We encountered two types of pines: Western White Pine and Whitebark Pine, and enjoyed fantastic views of Cutthroat Peak and Cutthroat Ridge. The lake is named for the red-necked trout stocked in its alpine waters.

During the hike we spotted a Williamson's Sapsucker searching for a meal on the rough tree bark.

Overall, this was a wonderful trip to a remote area of our state. We canâ€™t wait to go back and explore more of the trails.
