On Tuesday, we ventured to Blue Lake, a lovely hike through dense forest that ends at the stunning glacial tarn. While mountain goat sightings are common in the area, we didnâ€™t see any that day. We did hear pikas and were awed by the imposing cliffs across the water.

On the way back, a lovely Canada jay hopped from branch to branch near the trail, completely unfazed by our presence.

Blue Lake is a popular climbing spot, and we had an amazing view of the Liberty Group spires, which included Liberty Bell Mountain, Concord Tower, Lexington Tower, and the Early Winters Spires.

After Blue Lake, our exploration continued with a visit to the Washington Pass Overlook, which is a short trail that offers panoramic views of the region.
