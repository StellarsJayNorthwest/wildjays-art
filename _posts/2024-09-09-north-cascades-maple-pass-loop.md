Although it’s less than a 3-hour drive from Seattle, the North Cascades National Park is one of the least visited national parks in the lower 48 states. Highway 20, the main road through the National Park complex, is typically snowbound between late November and late April, which leaves a short window to enjoy the trails in mild weather. We’ve been wanting to visit for several years, and we finally made the trip in early September.

Our first stop was the ranger station on Highway 20 to check on any trail closures due to the Pioneer Fire on the north shore of Lake Chelan. Cascade Pass was closed, but Maple Pass on the east side was still open. From the Diablo Lake Overlook, we watched fire helicopters fill their helibuckets from the dazzling blue waters of the lake. The air was hazy with smoke, but the views were still incredible. That night, we stayed in a cabin near Winthrop in the beautiful Methow Valley on the eastern side of the mountains.

We set out early the next morning for Maple Pass Loop. This hike seems to have everything the Pacific Northwest has to offer: ancient forests, an alpine lake (Lake Ann) nestled in a talus bowl, a waterfall, and stunning views of rugged peaks.

But our favorite sight was the pikas. Their bleats and cheeps reverberated around the talus fields as they busily carried vegetation to their winter hay piles nestled under the rocks. We’ve never seen so many pikas in one hike, and it was the highlight of the trip.

We also saw a lone marmot, who was sleeping on a sunny rock, oblivious to the antics of the diminutive lagomorphs scurrying around him.

After reaching Maple Pass at 6,650 feet, we followed the trail along a dramatic ridge between Lake Ann and Rainy Lake. The descent was challenging with a 2.5-mile drop of around 1,700 feet. It was an incredible day of hiking, and Maple Pass Loop has earned a spot on our favorite hikes of all time.
